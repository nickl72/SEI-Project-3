# SEI-Project-3

## Brewery searching React application. 
Application users may search for breweries in an area and learn more about what beers they provide. They can find a brewery's location on a map as well as learn more about it and link to its website.

### MVP
- User may browse or search breweries by many parameters
  - Search by city
  - Search by brewery name
  - Browse by zip code, state
  - Browse by brewery type
- Search results are displayed in a list on the page
- Search results are displayed as pins on a Google map
- Clicking on a returned brewery will display additional information about that brewery
- React hooks
- Brewery information will be displayed as a modal by the appropriate pin on the map

### Stretch Goals
- Use Redux for state management
- Use different map pins depending on type of establishment
- Use an API to find specific beers by brewery
- animations for modals
- Brewery show page to display more information, such as Google Places reviews
- User can create Bar crawl list of bars to visit

### Gold
- Bar crawl list includes routing on the map and finds the shortest overall path
- Export bar crawl list outside the site, email or SMS
